**A Data Analysis Problem:**

It is a problem I meet in an interview. The interviewer gave me a data set containing 1000 customers' buying, searching, liking, returning information of an online shopping website(all writen as numbers). He asked how I can decide whether there is something wrong with this online shopping web.

#####Note: 
I cannot find exact data to this problem, but something correlated.
